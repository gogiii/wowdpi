#+TITLE: Wow such DPI, much blacklist, we're trapped, very 1984

Extremely simple "workaround" bypassing russian site blacklist without usage of proxies, TOR, etc. 

*Note:* It works *only* for some ISPs which use DPI and packet mangling, for example ros****com.

Limitations:

 - Works only with some ISPs
 - Doesn't work with SSL
 - HTTP proxies destroy the magic
 - The loophole may be closed in the future
